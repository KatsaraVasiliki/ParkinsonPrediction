## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on the **early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD)** using **machine learning algorithms** to analyze **vocal signal data**. The goal is to evaluate different classifiers and feature-reduction techniques to identify the most effective methods for diagnosing PD.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, CART, LDA
- **Feature Reduction Methods:** PCA, RFE, Correlation Ranking, Statistical Significance Tests
- **Dataset:** Parkinson's voice dataset from Kaggle ([Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagarbapodara/parkinson-csv))

## **Results**

The study showed that **Random Forest** and **KNN** classifiers provided the best results for detecting PD with high **accuracy** and **sensitivity**. The combination of feature reduction methods such as **RFE** yielded the most reliable results.

---

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using **vocal signal data** and **machine learning** to detect **Parkinson's Disease** at early stages. The models and methods used here have the potential to serve as **non-invasive diagnostic tools** in telemedicine.
